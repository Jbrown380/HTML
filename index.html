    <p>My quarantine has been mostly calm and relaxing. I have gotten both vaccine shots
        so i am mostly ready to go out more. What i usually do inside is watch tv, play Games,
        walk my dog, etc. I do hope COVID goes away soon so most things will go back to
        normal. I love walking my dog, he is so hyper and adorable. His name is Jack,
        and we've had him for years now. I still play tons of games as usual, always
        something that i enjoy to. I try to spread my variety from time to time, but some
        games just aren't fun anymore.
